### Programming - III
 In this repository you can find issues related to topics of each module as mentioned below, as well as practical examples used in the computer science course.
 
### Unitis
The course is divided into 6 units.


* Unit 1: Introduction to Java, fundamental concepts.
* Unit 2: OOP
* Unit 3:  Programming with threads and asynchronous computations
* Unit 4: GUI with Swing
* Unit 5: Access to databases via JDBC
* Unit 6:  Introduction to mobile development in Java
